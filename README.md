# 📊 Transaction Anomaly Detector


## 🌟 About the Project

**Transaction Anomaly Detector** is a lightweight and beginner-friendly browser-based tool that detects suspicious patterns in financial transactions using core **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** — with **no machine learning** involved.

This tool is transparent, explainable, and ideal for those learning DSA or contributing to open-source.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **DSA-Powered Detection**: Uses algorithms like sliding window, graphs, hash maps, and tries.
- 📈 **Real-Time Results**: Instant analysis of uploaded transaction data.
- ⚡ **No Backend Required**: Fully functional in the browser — no server or database needed.
- 🔍 **Explainable Logic**: Transparent detection with no black-box ML models.

---

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- **Algorithms Implemented**:
  - Sliding Window
  - Graph Cycle Detection
  - Trie for Merchant Flagging
  - Hash Map Analysis

---

## 🧠 How It Works

Transactions are analyzed in real-time using the following DSA techniques:

| 🧮 Algorithm | 🔍 Detection Capability |
|---|---|
| Sliding Window | Rapid, high-frequency usage in a short time |
| Graph Cycle Detection | Circular or suspicious fund transfers |
| Trie Search | Suspicious merchant name patterns |
| Hash Maps | User behavior outliers and frequency spikes |

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions from everyone! Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, you can help improve the tool or suggest new features. This project is a great way to learn and apply fundamental DSA concepts in a practical setting.

This is a perfect project for **GSSoC’25**, **Hacktoberfest**, and other open-source programs.

### 🧩 How to Contribute
