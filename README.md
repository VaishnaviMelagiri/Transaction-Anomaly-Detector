# Transaction Anomaly Detector

This project is an **unsupervised machine learning solution** designed to detect fraudulent or anomalous transactions within a given dataset. By analyzing historical transaction data, it identifies patterns that deviate significantly from the norm, helping to flag potentially fraudulent activity.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Unsupervised Learning**: Detects anomalies without needing labeled fraudulent data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts to clean and prepare raw transaction data.
- **Model Training**: Builds an anomaly detection model on historical data.
- **Anomaly Scoring**: Assigns scores to transactions; higher scores indicate higher likelihood of being anomalies.
