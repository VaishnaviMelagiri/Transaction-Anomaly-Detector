# üìä Transaction Anomaly Detector  
![alt text](image.png)

## üåü About Transaction Anomaly Detector  
This is a simple, open-source web tool that detects suspicious patterns in financial transactions using core **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** ‚Äî without relying on machine learning. It is lightweight, explainable, and works entirely in your browser.

---

## ‚ú® Features  
- **DSA-Powered Detection**: Implements sliding window, hash maps, graphs, and trie-based techniques.  
- **Real Time Stats**: Displays anomalies, severity levels, and transaction summaries.  
- **Easy To Use**: Works in any browser with no backend or database.  
- **No Machine Learning Required**: Transparent and lightweight, with no training or black-box models.  

---

## üíª Technologies Used  
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- Core DSA Algorithms (Sliding Window, Graphs, Trie, Hash Maps)

---

## üß† How It Works  
Each transaction is analyzed in real-time using algorithms like:  
- **Sliding Window**: Detects rapid high-frequency usage  
- **Graph Cycle Detection**: Catches circular fund transfers  
- **Trie Search**: Flags suspicious merchant names  
- **Hash Map Analysis**: Spots unusual user patterns  

This results in a fast and efficient system that can be used in detecting suspicious transactions.
